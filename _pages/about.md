About Me
---
I'm a third-year PhD student at Johns Hopkins University advised by [Nicholas Andrews](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~noa/) and [Kevin Duh](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~kevinduh/). My general research interest is controllable text generation and reasoning for language models; currently, I'm working on uncertainty estimation and tool use for large language models. I received my BA in computer science from Smith College, where I worked on controllable music generation.
