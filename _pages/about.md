I'm a PhD student studying computer science at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Nicholas Andrews](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~noa/) and [Kevin Duh](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~kevinduh/). Previously, I received my BA in computer science from Smith College, where I worked on controllable music generation. I currently work in natural language processing; my general research interest is making large language models more reliable and safer. In particular, my recent work has been on uncertainty quantification and language model agents.
